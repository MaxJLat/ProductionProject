# Production Line Project
This is a production line program, designed to help organize and categorize products and assign them to a production line.<br />
This project was made by Maximilien Latura.<br />
This project was made as part of a semester long assignment to demonstrate the capability to use databases, Object orientated programming, and GUIs.<br />
I made this project for my Object Orientated programming class at Flordia Gulf Coast University.<br />
